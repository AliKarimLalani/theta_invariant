# A COMPUTATIONAL SURVEY OF THE THETA INVARIANT 

This repository is a work-in-progress and contains computations from a University of Toronto Excellence Award (UTEA) research project under the supervision of Prof. Dror Bar-Natan.  

The project studies the Θ (Theta) polynomial and its visualisation through RainbowPlots for families of knots, including torus, twisted torus, and pretzel knots.

The folder `computed_theta_files/` stores the outputs: Θ polynomial values together with their corresponding RainbowPlot images.

The notebooks will be added after I'm done cleaning them, and will make edits to the README etc.
